IDEA :-
In this difficult times of Covid-19 we all know how important it is to have a mask on your face.
It is also important to detect and tell if someone is not following the rules of using a mask at 
a work place which might put other people in danger. Hence, there has to be a mechanism to detect
if a person is wearing mask or not.

PROJECT :-
1) First we will create a simple classification model using CNN which will be able to classify what is the 
difference between having a mask and not having a mask. This you can find in model.py file.

2) Next we will try to load the same model and use it to predict the classification on the real time 
faces visible infront of the camera and draw the bounding boxes with a label and score to identify if our model
is working fine. This can be found in Detect-faces.py file.
